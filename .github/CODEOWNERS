# A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in
# gitignore files. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or
# team names using the standard @username or @org/team-name format.
#
# Users and teams must have explicit write access to the repository, even if
# the team's members already have access.
#
# If you want to match two or more code owners with the same pattern, all the
# code owners must be on the same line. If the code owners are not on the same
# line, the pattern matches only the last mentioned code owner.

# The default policy and be overridden by the following rules.
